# NOTE!

This library is included in the core proxy, it is not necessary to build and
install this module if you wish to use a ketama-like hash. Please see the main
proxy documentation: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Proxy

This file exists as an example on how to build a 3rd party library if you need
compatible support with a specialized hashing method.
