# Lua libraries for memcached proxy

This repository contains Lua "route libraries" for usage with the Proxy. It
also has examples for C extensions to the Proxy for key distribution and key
hashing.

Memcached's builtin proxy comes with very few algorithms for hashing and key
distribution. This repository contains compat libs for older or customized
algorithms for backwards compatibility or migration purposes.
